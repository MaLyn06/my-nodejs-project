1. Problem to be Solved
    The problem we are addressing is the need to automate the process of scraping content from a webpage and creating a summary of that content. 
    Here's how the system works:
        Content Scraping: The system retrieves text from a given webpage.
        Summary Creation: Once the text is fetched, a concise summary is generated using an AI tool.
        Job Management: Each task is tracked, including important details like the URL, task status, the summary, any error messages, and timestamps.
    This system allows users to initiate tasks, monitor their progress, and receive updates on whether the task is complete or failed. This makes it easy to manage and track jobs.

2. Technical Specification
    This system is built using Node.js, and it automates the processes of scraping content from webpages and generating summaries. Here's how the system is structured:
    
    Components:
        Express: A web framework used to build the API that powers the system.
        MongoDB: A database used to store job details such as URLs, status, content, timestamps, etc.
        Puppeteer: A tool that scrapes content from webpages by simulating a browser.
        OpenAI API: This API is used to generate summaries for the scraped content.
        Jest: A testing framework used to ensure the system functions correctly.
        TypeScript: The entire codebase is written in TypeScript, ensuring better type safety, reducing runtime errors, and providing enhanced code readability and maintainability.
    How It Works:
        Create a Job: A user sends a request to start a job with a URL and, optionally, content.
        Scraping: If no content is provided, Puppeteer scrapes the webpage for text. If scraping fails or returns no content, the job is marked as failed.
        Summary Creation: Once the content is available, OpenAI generates a summary.
        Job Updates: The job status is updated based on whether the process is successful or if there’s an error:
        If successful, the job is marked as "completed."
        If there’s an error, the job is marked as "failed" and includes an error message.
        API Response: After the task is processed, the system returns the job ID, URL, and status.
    Additionally, a folder has been included with diagrams, including a flowchart and sequence diagram, to illustrate the process and how it works.

3. Technical Decisions
    1. MongoDB
        Why MongoDB? We chose MongoDB because it is flexible and can easily handle the unstructured data (such as job status, content, error messages). It also scales well as the system grows.
    2. Puppeteer for Scraping
        Why Puppeteer? Puppeteer simulates a real browser, which is important for scraping modern websites that use JavaScript to load their content.
    3. OpenAI for Summarization
        Why OpenAI? We use OpenAI’s GPT-4 model for summarization because it generates high-quality, coherent summaries from complex textual data.
    4. Mongoose for Data Management
        Why Mongoose? Mongoose provides a structure for managing data within MongoDB and helps us track job details like status, errors, and content.
    5. Error Handling and Status Tracking
        Why Error Handling? It's important to handle errors properly. If scraping or summarization fails, the system will mark the job as failed and provide helpful error messages.
    Additionally I’ve structured the project into models, controllers, routes, and services within the src folder, with each part serving a specific function:
        - Models define the data format (like the Job model for storing job information).
        - Controllers handle the business logic, such as job creation and status updates.
        - Routes manage how users interact with the system, routing requests to the appropriate controller.
        - Services carry out the main tasks, such as scraping content and generating summaries.
    This organization helps keep the system clean, easy to maintain, and ready for future scalability.

4. How was the solution achieves the admin’s desired outcome per the user story?
    This system achieves the admin’s desired outcome of automating content scraping and summarization by:
        Efficient Job Handling: The system handles user requests and starts the process of scraping and summarizing content automatically.
        Job Status Tracking: It tracks each job's status, so admins can see if the job is in progress, completed, or failed.
        Providing Feedback: Admins can check each job's status and review any errors through a unique job ID.
        Scalability: The system can handle multiple jobs at once, though it would need further improvement for very large volumes of tasks.
5. Proof of Concept vs. Production-Ready
    Proof of Concept (PoC)
        This system is currently a proof of concept (PoC), demonstrating the core functionality of scraping and summarizing content. It works well for basic use cases, but it's not yet optimized for large-scale, production environments.

To Make This Production-Ready:
    The system would need the following improvements:
Improve Efficiency:
    Use job queues and parallel processing to handle tasks more quickly and efficiently.
Enhance Security:
    Add input validation and safety measures to protect against malicious attacks.
Better Error Handling:
    Improve error tracking, implement retry logic for temporary failures, and set up system monitoring.
Performance Improvements:
    Address slowdowns caused by tools like Puppeteer and the OpenAI API to ensure faster performance.
